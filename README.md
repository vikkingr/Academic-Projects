# Academic-Projects >>> project1

Hello there!
I am just uploading my first project for my Internet Programming course. 
I strictly followed the directions on this one.
The Create Account Page's form is intended to work with the web server used by UNF's computer science department, and, at the timeframe of the project, fully functional.
The form handler may be out of service due to the school's security reasons or perhaps because project 1 is now over and there is no need for more support for the server.

Have a wonderful day!
