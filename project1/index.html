            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Hello World, <br>
                My dream is to be a better web developer every day. <br>
                I am passionate about software development and creating apps. <br>
                I love to appreciate this life with friends and family, <br>
                I enjoy surfing, producing music, going to the gym and taking nice walks in nature. <br><br>

                I have been learning HTML, CSS for almost two years and JavaScript for <br>
                almost a year now. <br>
                From there I started learning about frameworks and libraries <br>
                such as ReactJS, ExpressJS and Bootstrap, and databases as well such <br>
                as MongoDB, PostgreSQL and now mySQL. <br>
                After experimenting with web page creation and design, I started to ponder about <br>
                the next level. <br>
                For me, this was creating full-stack applications. <br>
                I started learning about NodeJS to see what the 
                <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Express.js">ExpressJS</a> 
                framework was doing for me behind <br>
                the scenes. <br>
                After creating a few apps with 
                <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/React_(web_framework)">React</a> and learning about 
                <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firebase">Firebase</a>, <br>
                I decided to gravitate toward this field entirely. <br>
                I am now super excited to recieve a proper education about this subject matter <br>
                from a professor at UNF!

                Hobbies & Interest
            </h2>
            <p>
                My hobbies usually orbit around surfing, making music, <br>
                learning something new, taking walks, running  and finding new <br>
                ways to enjoy life with myself, with my friends and with my family. <br>
                <br>
                If you've already guessed, my favorite hobby would be surfing! <br>
                I usually surf whenever there are waves because I love it. <br>
                But usually nothing gets me more stoked that some good ol' overhead surf. <br>
                I know, it's pretty scarce in Florida to actually get these big waves, but <br>
                the energy and fun that those waves produce are an unparalled beast of posivite vibes. <br>

                My interests are to finish my degree, to continue learning <br>
                about Web and Software Development best practices and tools like <br>
                ReactJS, Firebase and Docker, to keep working on side projects, to be <br>
                kind and to live a happy life!

            <h2>
                Education
            </h2>
            <h3>Past Experience</h3>
            <p>
                I have been attending the University of North Florida for almost two years now! <br>
                While UNF is my most recent, it certainly is not the only as I have been on a <br>
                journey through many different places such as St. Augustine High School. <br>
                Apart from the hometown beginnings, I travelled to Daytona to attend <br>
                Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University for Aviation Business Administration. <br>
                I wasn't really a fan of my studies there, also, it was extremely expensive. <br>
                So, I ventured to St. John's River State College, formerly a community college, <br>
                and completed my Associate of Arts in General Education.<br>
                It was at SJR that my programming aspirations came to fruition, which, <br>
                have lead me on my journey to UNF. I am very grateful to be here. <br>
            </p>
            <h3>Goals and Interests</h3>
            <p>
                I dream of doing really great things with my academic and personal knowledge <br>
                of programming or software concepts. With that being said, I truly do <br>
                aspire to be the best software developer that I can be and to learn <br>
                something new every day. <br>
                I have created a few apps and webpages already and plan to create <br>
                many more to experiment, get experience, to learn and to engineer business <br>
                solutions. <br>
                I plan to finish my Computer Science degree here at UNF. I love learning <br>
                about Computer Science in general, honestly; <br>
                I was mind-blown by <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_mathematics">Computational Structures (Discrete Math)</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_computation">Theory of Computation</a>. <br>
                I love the modern side of programming even more in classes like Data Structures <br>
                and Programming 1 and 2. <br>
                I am very excited to be in this very class to learn about a personal interest, <br>
                web development. I do imagine succeeding in my academic and hence my career goals. <br>
